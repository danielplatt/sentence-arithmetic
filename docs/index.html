      Here you can experiment with sentence embeddings that take a sentence and produce a point in the plane. Behind the scenes, a point in 384 dimensions is computed, but for simplicity we produce a two-dimensional picture from this. Like the English language, the picture is quite complicated. One thing you can see is that for most pairs of active/passive voice sentences, the passive voice sentence is to the lower right of the active sentence. You can try this out with your own sentence pair! If you want to learn more about it, you can read our article in which we measured and quantified this phenomenon. The corresponding article is:

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      Type an active/passive voice sentence pair into the boxes below and click submit. For example, you can try the following pair. Passive: "The car is chased by the dog." Active: "The dog chases the car." You will see two dots appear in the picture below: one for your active sentence, one for your passive sentence. Typically, the passive sentence is to the top right of the active sentence. For some rare sentence pairs, that is not the case, but we were unable to figure out when exactly that happens. If you have problems using this tool, or any ideas, comments, or questions about the project, please contact us at <a href="mailto:daniel.platt.berlin@gmail.com">daniel.platt.berlin@gmail.com</a>.
